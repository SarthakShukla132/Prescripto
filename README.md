A full-stack web application built using the MERN stack that simplifies the process of booking, managing, and overseeing doctor appointments. This app is designed with three levels of user access, providing customized functionalities for patients, doctors, and administrators.

In this we have added three levels of login -

patient login where patient can login and book the appointments.

Doctors login where doctors can manage their appointments and check their earnings and update their profile.

Admin Login where admin can create and manage doctors profile .

Along with that we have also added the online payment gateway in this app so that the user can pay appointment fee online.
